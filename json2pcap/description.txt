This script is for json to pcap translation, written in 2.7 python.
Due note that on line 126 a path to "text2pcap" (in wireshark's directory) needs to be provided.

In order to try using the script I have exported sniffed packets as json and named it "test". 
Then I have executed the script and gave the json file as an input. 
Instead of generating a pcap file with all the packets I had initially sniffed, it generated an empty pcap file.

I understood the tool "text2pcap" converts a hexdump, in a specific form, into a pcap file.
To test it I have made two new files after a wireshark sniffing, a json and a hexdump (see examples).
After executing "text2pcap" I had two pcap files. The first was created when given the json as input, and it was empty.
The second was created when given the hexdump as input, and it contained all the packets.

Because of that I think the script doesn't translate the json file to the correct form, and consequently the generated pcap is empty.
